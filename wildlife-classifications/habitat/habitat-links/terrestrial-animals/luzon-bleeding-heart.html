<h1><b>Luzon Bleeding Heart</b></h1>
<p>Gallicolumba luzonica</p>
<p class="description">The Luzon bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba luzonica ) is one of a number of species of ground dove in the genus Gallicolumba that are called "bleeding-hearts". The native name in Tagalog is punay. It is also known as paloma de punalada 'stabbed pigeon'. The Luzon Bleeding-heart is the species in which the "blood" feature is most pronounced, with the reddish hue extending down the belly, furthering the illusion of blood having run down the bird's breast.</p>

<h2 class="section-title"><b>Appearance</b></h2>
<p style="color:Black;">The genus Gallicolumba has a number of species known as "bleeding-hearts", ground doves that get this name due to a splash of bright red in the middle of their white breast. Luzon bleeding-hearts are among these, their species is the one where the color is most vivid, making it look as though it has been wounded. Males and females look very similar, though females are duller overall, and their red breast patch is smaller and paler.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">This bird is endemic to the island of Luzon and two other islands in northern Philippines. Here there are many populations that are isolated, and on the island of Polillo, a very small population was recently rediscovered, and on Catanduanes only one specimen has been found. This species lives in lowland forest and the majority of the time it feeds on the forest floor. These birds nest and roost in trees of low to medium height, shrubbery and vines.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">These birds are monogamous and maintain strong bonds, usually pairing for life. At the time of breeding, the male attracts a female with his courtship display. He chases the female displaying his inflated breast to show fully his vivid red marking or "heart". Once he has the femaleâ€™s attention, he bows his head and lovingly coos to his intended mate. Mid-May is probably the time of nesting, when other subspecies in the same genus will nest on nearby islands of the Philippines. Breeding pairs in captivity can mate all year round. 2 creamy white eggs are laid and both parents incubate them for between 15 and 17 days. Although after 10 to 14 days young leave their nest, their parents feed them for as long as another month. When they are 2 to 3 months old the young start to develop their adult plumage and need to be separated from their parents, otherwise the parents will attack and will sometimes kill them. At 18 months, the young go through another molt, becoming reproductively mature.</p>

<section class="population-threats">
<h2><b>Population Threats</b></h2>
<p style="color:Black;">Luzon bleeding-hearts suffer from habitat fragmentation and loss, caused by the expansion of agriculture and deforestation for timber. This species is also vulnerable to hunting and also trapping for the trade in pets, as it popular as a cage bird.</p>

<section class="population-number">
<h2><b>Population Number</b></h2>
<p style="color:Black;">The IUCN Red List and other sources do not provide the Luzon bleeding-heart total population size. Currently this species is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.</p>
</section>
<section class="ecological-niche">
<h2><b>Ecological Niche</b></h2>
<p style="color:Black;">Through seed dispersal, these birds help ensure the success of their forest habitats.</p>
